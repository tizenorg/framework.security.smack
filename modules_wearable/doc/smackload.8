.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smackload
is a tool that can be used to load Smack rules into the kernel or to remove rules that have already been loaded.  The general use of

without a path name will allow you to enter rules on the command line, these take the format "%s %s %s\\n"
.B (subject object access_type)
with ^D terminating the session and writing the rules to the kernel. The
.B access_type
refers to the access modes that are from the set "rwaxt", which refer to read, write, append, execute and transmute access respectively
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-c
Clear the specified rules from the kernel
.IP path
The path to the file from which to read the rules

.SH EXIT STATUS
On success
.B smackload
returns 0 and 1 on failure.
